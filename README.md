# keeper_frontend

The design and core features of this application was created based on the curriculum of [The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013gG3@v0148dunw-WIoZ_10sOStqWzPC4srj6Lrd_IYDDU9vEqXHWT6xQkCw3EC7CorpjRHw==/) .

I have updated the following since the base application was not assosiated with DB, etc.
- add crud function using Mongo DB. Refer to the [keeper_api](https://github.com/atoook/keeper_api) repository as well.
- add function to edit the note
- refactoring some of the components

New features are to be added in the future.
